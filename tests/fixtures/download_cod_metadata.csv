 The shapefile, geodatabase, and EMF layers sourced from Le Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP) have been vetted and configured by ITOS. Topological errors have been fixed and the lines layer is now available. The live geoservices are currently those provided before the September 2023 earthquake, but will be updated shortly.
 
 
 
 NOTE ABOUT P-CODES. The _Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP)_ source data contained place codes that did not reference administrative level 1 (regions). To maintain consistency with the previous COD-AB - as well as the live geoservices that are currently in place - the new layers maintain the P-coding at administrative levels 1 and 2 and then append the HCP place coding for administrative levels 3 and 4.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 SEPTEMBER 15 2023 UPDATE
 
 The administrative level 0-4 gazetteer spreadsheet and geodatabase is now available.
 
 The large number of topology errors prohibits creation of a lines layer until they can be corrected.
 
 
 
 
 
 SEPTEMBER 14 2023 UPDATE
 
 This dataset now contains a preliminary set of administrative level 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 shapefiles recently derived from Le Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP). Administrative level 0, 1, and 2 P-codes match those in the other layers - and live geoservices - contained in this dataset. Administrative level 3 and 4 P-codes are derived from the HCP layers.
 
 
 
 These new layers are more detailed than the previous layers but contain topological errors.
 
 
 
 The gazetteer spreadsheet, lines file, and geodatabase will be prepared shortly.
 
 
 
 Live services remain unaltered.

 PESS gathered basic critical information on the Somalis living in urban, rural and nomadic areas (interviewed at water points during the peak of the long, dry season), and in settlements for internally displaced persons. One standard questionnaire was used in selected enumeration areas or pre-identified areas. Data was collected in three main phases: cartographic field mapping, household listing in the sampled areas, and the interviewing of households using the standard questionnaire.
 
 
 
 PESS report by UNFPA had only the population estimate at regional level (Admin level 1).

 24 NOVEMBER UPDATES:
 
 Due to the structural inconsistency of the best available administrative level 3 boundary information it has been removed from the standard gazetteer, shapefile, geodatabase, web service, and EMF resources and P-coding of populated places resource.

 This dataset was updated in August 2023 to reflect the adjustment of the ""Namutina"" (formerly [SS100902]) ADM3 feature from the ""Tambura' [SS1009] ADM2 feature to the ""Nagero"" [SS1007] ADM2 feature. The ""Namutina"" P-code is changed from [SS100902] (which has been retired) to [SS100702]. The ADM2 layer is therefore also changed. All affected changes are in the ""Western Equatoria"" [SS10] ADM1 feature and so the ADM0 and ADM0 layers remain unaltered although the lines layer has been updated.

 The lines layer (""ssd_admbndl_ALL_2022"") has the following special features, with specific admLevel coding as follows:
 
 
 
 admLevel 79: That part of the Abyei region boundary that borders the rest of South Sudan. (Abyei region is not included in the polygon layers.)
 
 
 
 admLevel 78: That part of the Abyei region boundary that borders Sudan.
 
 
 
 admLevel 77: The remainder of the boundary between South Sudan and Sudan.
 
 
 
 admLevel 76: The northern boundary of the disputed area known as the Ilemi Triangle between South Sudan and Kenya. (This line is not a boundary of any administrative polygon.)

Admin COD datasets (Admin 0 ‚Äì 2) for Nigeria are endorsed by the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (OSGOF) and the IMWG Feb 2017. See metadata for description of methodology for admin level 3 and the cleaning and processing performed by ITOS. Levels 0 - 3 are polygonal administrative units, Level 3 only covers Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States and are for operational purposes only. 
 
 
 
 A senatorial district shapefile is also included. Senatorial districts respect administrative level 1 (state) but are not reflected in the gazetteer, geodatabase, or live services.
